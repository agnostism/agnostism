- 👋 Hi there, I'm Kaori, a CS student interested in [generative machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model) and AI ethcs.
- ❤ I love exploring projects related to synthetic media, penetration testing and coding theory.
- 📚 I'm currently learning about [MDL methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_description_length) and researching AI-based compression schemes.
- 🌊 I've been working on [Ocean](https://github.com/kaeori/ocean), a deep learning framework built from scratch.
- 🌺 ...and [Akiko](https://github.com/kaeori/akiko), a modular source code optimizer for Python. 
- 💻 I'm trying to learn Rust and get to grips with Solidity. 
- 🍇 I love grapes!
- 📫 Feel free to drop an email at [kaeori@proton.me](mailto:kaeori@proton.me).
